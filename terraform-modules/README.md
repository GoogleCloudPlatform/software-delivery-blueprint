# Overview

This folder is hydrated into a repo called `terraform-modules` during the execution of the [`software-delivery-infra.sh`][software-delivery-infra] script. The purpose of this repository is to store Terraform  modules used throughout the platform. `terraform-modules` contains the modules used by application and IaC pipelines.

Terraform modules enable platform administrators to create shared configuration for infrastructure that encapsulate the best practices for their organization, establishing guardrails for self-service infrastructure.

## Rendering pattern

Some modules in this repository follow a rendering pattern. With that pattern
the module generates some Terraform and commits it back into the
`terraform-modules` repository. The rendered Terraform is typically consumed
by downstream pipelines.

An example of this pattern is with [Cloud Deploy][cloud-deploy] targets. When
provisioning a [Google Kubernetes Engine][gke] (GKE) cluster, it will generate
Terraform that is then used by application projects to create a Cloud Deploy
target, so that the target can be used in a Cloud Deploy pipeline.

## Module catalog

| Name                   | Description
| ---------------------- | --------------
| acm                    | Installs and configures [Anthos Config Managment][acm] (ACM). This module also creates base cluster and cluster selectors in the ACM repo.
| app-group-admin-seed   | Deploys the base project for an application group. This module does the minimum necessary to create the project and establish the IaC pipeline for that application group. The application IaC pipeline takes the responsibility of building out the remainder of the application admin project.
| app-group-copy-secrets | Helper module to streamline the copying of secrets from one project to another.
| artifact-registry      | Creates [Artifact Registry][artifact-registry] for an application group.  This module also uses the render pattern to manage IAM access on the registry to allow multi-tenant GKE clusters service account.
| cloud-deploy-targets   | This module creates [Cloud Deploy targets][cloud-deploy-target] in application admin projects for use by the [Cloud Deploy pipeline][cloud-deploy-pipeline]. This module also includes a submodule that renders the Terraform to create the Cloud Deploy targets.
| github-triggers        | Creates [Cloud Build][cloud-build] triggers using the [GitHub application][cloud-build-github].
| gke                    | Deploys [GKE][gke] clusters, typically used in the multi-tenant platform projects.
| landing-zone           | Using the rendering pattern and ACM, this module creates a landing zone in the multi-tenant infrastructure including a namespace, workload identity and network policy.
| manage-repos           | This module contains submodules to create the application and infrastructure as code repostories on GitHub. Additional source control providers could be added here.
| manage-teams           | This modules manages teams and their members in GitHub.
| project                | Create Google Cloud projects and provides a variable to enabled additional Google Cloud APIs as need by the application teams.
| secrets                | Helper module to create and managed secrets in [Secret Manager][secret-manager].
| vpc                    | Base module to create VPC networks.
| webhooks               | Creates Cloud Build triggers using [webhooks][cloud-build-webhook].
